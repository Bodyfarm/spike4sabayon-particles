Ultamate ownership of the project as far as 
I am concered is the Sabayon Linux  Foundation.
I Michael R. Lawrence , am esentially doing this as a graduate IT security Project , and out of Freewill
I am Mearly a contributor., I am the Lessor of the owners Verses the Sabayon Linux & Linux comunity as a whole.
whom with all my toil , I do hope , shall benfit all, even if I remain mostly nameless. 

I mearly "bowrrowing code", then trying to make a few improvements, even if I wrote it, contributed it.
I'm just a User trying to help out, my programing is feeble. Infistructure support (Network admin Windows/Linux)
and IT security Admin are the trade craft I know best.  not having good Security tools to do the job and upto date 
and having to defend a network or two , is a sore spot I know well. 

Pardon me while I make a mess of things for a bit , then consolidate down , release a good Sabayon Spin canidate. 

Licence is GPL 
So, 

Feel free to Help Out Sabayon Linux !!!.
