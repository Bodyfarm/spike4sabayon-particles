Some Security and other useful toys

I'm just a Resercher of IT security and forensics.

do note i'm Dyslexic , so error checking by another pair of eyes is to the wise. 
if it weren't for spell check , life as a Graduate student would be painful. 

hopefully the package build particles serve others , 
as well , as making a PenTest spin for Sabayon Linux all that much eassier.

hopefully the Sabayon Dev team can take the particles and use them till thiers something better. 

mainly to build a few extra security Toys and packages. IE Metaslpoit and the like , and keep it all nice and fresh.
